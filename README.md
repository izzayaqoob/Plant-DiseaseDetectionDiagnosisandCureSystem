# PlantDiseaseDetectionDiagnosisandCureSystem


An end-to-end deep learning system that empowers farmers and home gardeners to accurately identify plant diseases, understand their symptoms, and discover effective treatment options.

### Features:

 #### 1. Accurate Disease Detection: 
 Leverages a fine-tuned ResNet50 model to identify 40 different diseases across 11 plant species with over 90% accuracy.

####  2. In-depth Diagnosis: 
Provides detailed information on disease symptoms, causes, and contributing environmental factors.

####  3. Curative Recommendations: 
Suggests both organic and chemical treatment plans, including dosage and application guidelines.

####  4. User-Friendly Web Interface: 
Intuitive Flask-based web app for easy image upload and instant predictions.

####  5. Multilingual Support: 
Designed for accessibility, with support for multiple languages to serve a global user base.

#### Note: 
* The model is trained on kaggle with two datasets i.e PlantVillage and New-Plant-Diseases-Dataset
* There is a folder named template under which the step-by-step guide is available that how the prediction part is carried out
* You can follow those steps and train your model on kaggle platform and combine it with with Flask and html/css for interface development and routing
